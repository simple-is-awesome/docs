Today is April 1, 2023, 2 weeks before the first draft of the graduation is submitted. So far, the basic functions of the personal blog system have been developed.

In the past 10 days, with the help of chatgpt4, new bing, search engines, and official documentation, I have come up with a working blogging system. [link](https://demo.njxzc.top)

## 1„ÄÅtechnology stack

Let's start with the technology stack: Next.js+Tailwind CSS+Supabase+Vercel.
The combination of these technology stacks provides a complete solution for building modern web applications. The following is a brief description of the uses of each of these technologies:

- Next.js:

Next.js is a React-based open source framework for building server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) web applications. It provides powerful features such as automatic code segmentation, optimized image handling, and a rapid development environment to help developers easily build high-performance, SEO-optimized Web applications.

- Tailwind CSS:

Tailwind CSS is a feature-rich CSS framework designed to provide a fast solution for building user interfaces through utility classes. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS does not provide predefined UI components, but rather a set of underlying, composable CSS classes that allow developers to quickly build custom-designed web applications.

- Supabase:

Supabase is an open source Firebase replacement that provides Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) functionality. It provides real-time databases, authentication, storage, and other back-end features to help developers quickly build the back end of their Web applications. supabase can greatly reduce the effort of manually building and managing back-end infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on front-end development.

- Vercel:

Vercel is a cloud platform focused on providing one-stop deployment, hosting and autoscaling services for Jamstack applications such as the Next.js app. Vercel provides a simple deployment process, global CDN, seamless integration and other features that enable developers to quickly release their web applications to production environments with high performance and reliability.

By combining Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase and Vercel, developers can quickly build, deploy and host high-performance, scalable, modern web applications while focusing on business logic and user interface and reducing the effort of manually managing the infrastructure.
