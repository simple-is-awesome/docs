## 1. Reason1: Shocking feeling

The fundamental reason for integrating chatgpt in my personal blog system is the shocking feeling that chatgpt brings to me.

After I experienced it as it came out at the end of November last year, I have a feeling that this technology is a windfall opportunity 
and the future trend is definitely chatgpt+, all industries can integrate chatgpt to improve their work efficiency. 

If you don't embrace chatgpt, you will be eliminated by the times. Always bear in mind that Those who are eliminated are those can't keep up with the times.

Chatgpt 3.5 maybe stupid sometimes, but chatgpt4 has improved a lot. Since released in 2023.03.14, I can't lose it anymore. It's so amazing and attractive.

The tailwind css style of my graduation project was done by chatgpt4, and most of the expression of my graduation thesis was also done by chatgpt4.

It has improved my efficiency in both life and study, allowing me to be flexible in areas that I am not currently good at and to get rid of some uncreative red tape.

Although chatgpt is so powerful (chatgpt4), only some part of the group can talk to the ai efficiently and really unleash its power. How to use prompt to efficiently 
get answers from the ai mouth is a compulsory  course for each of us.

For example, if I want to use chatgpt to help me write a certain part of my paper, I will provide the main points to chatgpt as much as possible, and 
add the words "expression should make the lowest rate of cnki paper check" at the end.

## 2. Reason2: ChatGPT+ is popular

The rest of the reason is that major foreign content creation brands have been integrating chatgpt, and here are some of the foreign content 
creation brands that I think compelled me to integrate chatgpt in my personal blogging system.

- ifttt ai

ifttt, a famous online service provider that connects various Internet services, launched ifttt ai on March 21, 2023. Among the ai applets, 
the one I want to try the most is `AI generated tweets for your Blog posts`, which solves the problem of manually promoting blogs 
in social media once they are published.
