# The reason for personal blog system to integrate chatgpt

The fundamental reason for integrating chatgpt in my personal blog system is the shocking feeling that chatgpt brings to me, after I experienced it the night it came out at the end of November last year, I have a feeling that this technology is a windfall and the future trend is definitely chatgpt+, all industries can integrate chatgpt to improve their work efficiency.

The tailwind css style of my graduation project was done by chatgpt, and most of the presentation of my graduation thesis was also done by chatgpt.

It has improved my efficiency in both life and study, allowing me to be flexible in areas that I am not currently good at and to get rid of some uncreative red tape.

Although chatgpt is so powerful (chatgpt4), but can really unleash its power, only that part of the group can talk to the ai, how to use prompt to efficiently get answers from the ai mouth, is a mandatory course for each of us.

For example, if I want to use chatgpt to help me write a certain part of my paper, I will provide the main points to chatgpt as much as possible, and add the words "expression to know the lowest rate of web check" at the end.

The rest of the reason is that major foreign content creation brands have been integrating chatgpt, and here are some of the foreign content creation brands that I think compelled me to integrate chatgpt in my personal blogging system.

- ifttt ai

ifttt, a famous online service provider that connects various Internet services, launched ifttt ai on March 21, 2023. Among the ai applets, the one I want to try the most is `AI generated tweets for your Blog posts`, which disguisedly solves the problem of manually promoting blogs in social media once they are published. This disguises the problem that once a blog is posted, you need to promote it manually on social media.
