#### d. Build and deploy with docker

:::tip

Q: Why don't you provide a dockerhub image and pull it directly for deployment?

A: Because Next.js will inline environment variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` into the docker image when building the docker image, which will cause the environment variables in .env file to not load into the docker container at all. 

Although there are solutions on the web such as adding entrypoint.sh, these solutions are either tedious or require sacrificing the performance of Next.js (which converts static generation to server-side rendering), 

so it is safer to build your own docker image and deploy it with docker compose.

:::

```bash
# Clone git repository
git clone https://github.com/simple-is-awesome/simple.git
# Go to the folder
cd simple
# Rename the file
mv .env.example .env
# Build a docker image named "blog"
docker build -t blog .
# Start and run the docker container as defined in the docker-compose.yml file
docker compose up -d
```

#### e. Update

```bash
# Stop and delete the services (containers) and their related resources defined by the docker-compose.yml file
docker compose down

# Modify .env or secondary development (see below for explanation of modification process)

# Re-create a docker image named "blog"
docker build -t blog .
# Start and run the docker container as defined in the docker-compose.yml file
docker compose up -d
# Force delete all images that are not referenced by a container
docker image prune -af
```
