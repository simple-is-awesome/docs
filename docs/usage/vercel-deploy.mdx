- f. New articles

You can open your GitHub repository page and find the repository created in Vercel's deployment.

![vercel新创建的仓库页面](https://vip2.loli.io/2023/05/16/k2E1DxIvY4iwnmU.webp)

Enter the keyboard `. ` decimal key, using the editor of github.dev, to display the repository file.

![用github.dev展示仓库文件](https://vip2.loli.io/2023/05/16/NIzFvEt2UgXePT9.webp)

Find the posts folder and create a new md or mdx file in that folder.

![新建文件](https://vip2.loli.io/2023/05/16/4kAwNiEaUBo7QuK.webp)

For example, I created a new Markdown file called test.md in the posts folder. and then add frontmatter and text content to this MarkDown file.

example:

```markdown
---
title: '测试'
date: '2023-05-16'
tags: ['test']
slug: 'test'
summary: 'test'
showtoc: false
---

测试一下！
```

The frontmatter is the article's metadata, which provides the article's title, date, tags, links, summary and other information that you can write on demand.
Among them, title, date, tags, slug, summary are required, showtoc optional, if you need to make the article display article toc, you can change the showtoc 
parameter to true, If you don't add showtoc parameter, the default value is false, it means that don't show the article toc.

![Push Code](https://vip2.loli.io/2023/05/16/pAMcBanWVRGmJoQ.webp)

Next, click source code control on the left side of the web-based vscode editor, fill in the commit information, and click Commit & Push to push the newly 
created article to the GitHub repository.

![Back to the GitHub repository page](https://vip2.loli.io/2023/05/16/vMeLBCVA2S1yRWx.webp)

After this, change github.dev to github.com in the browser address bar to return to the original GitHub repository page.

![View newly added files](https://vip2.loli.io/2023/05/16/zANa6dx2btT48H3.webp)

Expand on the posts folder, check the new test.md you just created. The image above shows that it has been successfully pushed to the GitHub repository.

Come to the deployment screen of vercel. You can see that vercel monitored the changes to the repository and triggered an automatic deployment 
and the site has been deployed automatically.

Refresh the site and the article you just added is already displayed at the top.

- g. Delete articles, edit articles

The steps are the same as f, just manipulate the files in the posts folder, in which you can modify the article.

You can go directly to the article page, the first part of each article has a hyperlink to edit the article.

Click on the hyperlink, you can jump directly to the corresponding file page of GitHub.
